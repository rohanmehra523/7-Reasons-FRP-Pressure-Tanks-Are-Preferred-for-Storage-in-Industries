# 7-Reasons-FRP-Pressure-Tanks-Are-Preferred-for-Storage-in-Industries
When selecting a building material for storage tanks, there are a few key factors to keep in mind before making a decision. The selection of appropriate materials must be made so that it benefits both the people within the industrial unit, who will be working with the material as well as the end-users. One such material used for storage tanks is fiber-reinforced polymer or FRP which is highly beneficial for various reasons. <br>
FRP Pressure Vessels are an ideal choice for residential, commercial as well as industrial water treatment applications. FRP is inherently corrosion-resistant, and wards off chemicals, salt, and water. FRP tanks are built with strong exteriors, are corrosion-resistant, watertight, lightweight, and easy to customize and install. <br>

**Lower Production Time** <br>
The ability to prefabricate FRP products has reduced overall costs and also made the installation process much quicker and easier. This makes the customization of FRP tanks in terms of fitting and features much easier and quicker. The best FRP vessel manufacturer in India will help in acquiring FRP tanks that are suited to your purpose. <br>

**Low Installation Time** <br>
When selecting a storage tank or vessel for your industry, it is important to take into account the amount of time needed for each step in the transportation and installation processes. Saved time means saved costs, but sometimes the quality of the product is sacrificed for efficiency. However, this is not the case with FRP pressure tanks, which save valuable production and installation time while providing the necessary quality, strength, and durability. <br>

**Less Weight** <br>
FRP tank is known for being lightweight. It is about eight times lighter than concrete tanks and thus it is also less labor-intensive to install. They are just 2/3rd the weight of aluminum and 1/4th the weight of steel. FRP tanks also require much less labor in the removal and replacement processes. <br>

**Higher Strength to Weight Ratio** <br>
When it comes to resistance to impact, FRP will not permanently deform under a working load like steel and other metals. The strength-to-weight ratio is superior in FRP when compared to steel and aluminum tanks. FRP tanks are equipped with better resin treatment that makes them resistant to impact, heat, and cracks. <br>
Corrosion-resistant <br>

Apart from high durability and strength, FRP is resistant to corrosion, is long-lasting, and mitigates the need for ongoing maintenance.  This lack of frequent maintenance services and repairs helps on saving on expensive labor, and material costs and also prevents inconvenience to end-users. Since FRP is long-lasting and resistant to corrosion, the long-term costs also end up being much less. <br>

**Less Repair Work** <br>
FRP structures are highly reliable and low maintenance. This does not insinuate that an FRP tank is maintenance-free, there will be an occasional need for field service. Performing yearly routine inspections will help in ensuring that potential issues are caught before they pose a problem. Structures made of steel, concrete, and other metals are prone to regular repair work which is not the same for FRP. <br>

**Greater Return on Investment** <br>
FRP pressure vessels are extremely efficient and helpful for industries that store liquids and gases. Thus, to maintain operation, industries prefer to invest in FRP pressure tanks and vessels. FRP tank manufacturers provide tanks that are durable, easy to fabricate and maintain, and also high in resistance. <br>
Other advantages of using FRP pressure tanks are that they are resistant to heat, stress, conductivity, and harsh weather conditions. They are also slip-resistant when compared to metals and are highly recommended for industrial usage. FRP tanks are also less flammable in contrast to metal tanks. <br>

Thus, FRP is a widely used material in the construction of FRP pressure tanks and vessels that can be used both in chemical plants as well as water treatment systems. FRP vessel and tank manufacturers in India manufacture the FRP pressure tank by means of filament winding. FRP offers a wide range of unique benefits like short installation time, lightweight, maintenance savings, corrosion resistance, and longevity. So FRP tanks are a perfect choice for many industries that require the storage of fluids. <br>

**FRP tanks and vessels in water treatment plants**  <br>
As FRP is immune to liquids including water and harsh chemicals, many FRP tank manufacturers prefer using FRP in water treatment plants. In addition to this, it has many features that make it perfect for usage in water treatment plants like leak-proof keeps the flow of water easy and lucid, and flexibility that helps in giving it any desired shape and size. <br>
